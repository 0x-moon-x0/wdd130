        <h2>Kate</h2>
        <p>Hello there, everyone! My name is Kate; I'm 18 years old, and I'm currently studying for two separate bachelor's degrees. I'm studying Software Development at BYU-Idaho Online,
        and I'm also studying Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Gdansk in Poland. I'm from Ukraine, but unfortunately, I don't live there anymore. I'm also single.</p>
        <p>In my spare time (which I rarely have these days lol) I make all sorts of art, play drums, study languages, and play videogames.</p>
        <p>I chose to pursue a bachelor's degree in Software Development because I was always told that I have an intuitive understanding of computers. I was skeptical at first, 
        but it turned out to be a really fun and fruitful educational journey for me. I guess my mom was right after all (when was she ever wrong, though?). 
        I hope to one day use the knowledge I acquire at BYU-I to land my ideal position with special government investigation forces.</p>
        <p>It's a pleasure to meet all of you, I'm looking forward to getting to know each other more in the future! Thanks for your time reading this.</p>
