                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>It's good to see you here! I'm excited to tell you the story of how I raised my Garden Tiger Moth caterpillar and teach you about some useful care tips if you'd like to do the same.</p>
                <p>Before that, let's address some questions you might have.</p>

                <h2>Why would I want to raise a caterpillar?</h2>
                <p>You might think moth and butterfly babies are better off in the wild, but that's not necessarily true. Caterpillars have a very low survival rate out in the wild, so taking a caterpillar in and taking care of it at home greatly improves its chances of survival.</p>
                <p>Raising a caterpillar at home is a very rewarding experience. They make low-maintenance pets and give you the joy of witnessing them grow and transform over time!</p>

            <section class="question-2">
                <h2>Where do I get a caterpillar?</h2>
                <p>You can order exotic butterfly caterpillars online, or if you're like me, you could just take a walk outside in the warmer months and look for one! I personally think that it's part of the fun to look for one yourself, but either one of these would work.</p>
                <p>Depending on your region, you can find different species of moth and butterfly caterpillars on common local plants. Trees (oaks and willows) tend to host the most caterpillars, but you can also find them on plants such as milkweed, dill, and asters.</p>
                <p>Here I've prepared a small list of caterpillars you can find and the types you should avoid touching.</p>

            <section class="question-3">
                <h2>What if my caterpillar dies? </h2>
                <p>Sometimes nature is out of our hands, no matter what we do. So don't get discouraged if your baby caterpillar doesn't make it. The tips I provide here will hopefully help, but I can't guarantee that every caterpillar will survive. You can always try again, so keep your head up!</p>
